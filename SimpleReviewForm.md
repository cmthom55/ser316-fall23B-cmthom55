Exact Text for the Defect      | Type of Defect                            | Addressed  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| All source code files must have a file banner comment present and filled in. This banner is available in the templates.java file on Canvas. | CG | [ ] |
| All public classes must have a class banner comment present and filled in. This banner is available in the templates.java file. | CG | [ ] |
| All public methods, including constructors, except getter/setter methods, must have a method banner comment present and filled in. This banner is available in the templates.java file. | CG | [ ] |
| Naming conventions are as follows: | | |
|    a. Constants and Enums should be in all CAPS (example: PI) | CG | [ ] |
|    b. Class names should be upper CamelCase, with the first letter uppercase (example: MyClass). | CG | [ ] |
|    c. Variable, Parameter, and Method names should be in lower camelCase, with the first letter in lowercase (example: fooBar). | CG | [ ] |
| All attributes must be private (class member variables, not constants). | CG | [ ] |
| All literal values, except loop indices starting at 0 or 1 must be declared as constants. | CG | [ ] |
| All code should be consistent stylistically. This includes: | | |
|    a. All {} should appear with the { at the end of a line and } on its own line | CG | [ ] |
|    b. Indentation should be consistent. | CG | [ ] |
|    c. All complex statements (if, else, switch, loops) must use explicit {} even if the body is a single line. | CG | [ ] |
| Duplicate code | CS | [ ] |
| Large Class | CS | [ ] |
| Switch statements | CS | [ ] |
| Feature Envy: A class that uses methods of other class extensively | CS | [ ] |
| Lazy class: A class that does too little. | CS | [ ] |
| Excessive use of literals: these should be coded as named constants. | CS | [ ] |
| Data clump: A group of variables are passed around together in various parts of the program. Should rather be a single object with these members that can be passed. | CS | [ ] |
| Method has too many parameters | CS | [ ] |
| Long method | CS | [ ] |
| Too long identifiers | CS | [ ] |
| Too short identifiers | CS | [ ] |   
| Any defects that hinder the program from working correctly | FD | [ ] |
